            <span class="size"> Bhagavad Gita,</span> an episode recorded in the
            great Sanskrit poem of the Hindus, the Mahabharata. It occupies
            chapters 23 to 40 of Book VI of the Mahabharata and is composed in
            the form of a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and Krishna, an avatar
            (incarnation) of the god Vishnu. Composed perhaps in the 1st or 2nd
            century CE, it is commonly known as the Gita. On the brink of a
            great battle between warring branches of the same family, Arjuna is
            suddenly overwhelmed with misgivings about the justice of killing so
            many people, some of whom are his friends and relatives, and
            expresses his qualms to Krishna, his charioteer—a combination
            bodyguard and court historian. Krishna’s reply expresses the central
            themes of the Gita. He persuades Arjuna to do his duty as a man born
            into the class of warriors, which is to fight, and the battle takes
            place. Krishna’s argument incorporates many of the basic teachings
            of the Upanishads, speculative texts compiled between 1000 and 600
            BCE, as well as of the philosophy of Samkhya Yoga, which stresses a
            dualism between soul and matter (see mind-body dualism). He argues
            that one can kill only the body; the soul is immortal and
            transmigrates into another body at death or, for those who have
            understood the true teachings, achieves release (moksha) or
            extinction (nirvana), freedom from the wheel of rebirth. Krishna
            also resolves the tension between the Vedic injunction to sacrifice
            and to amass a record of good actions (karma) and the late
            Upanishadic injunction to meditate and amass knowledge (jnana). The
            solution he provides is the path of devotion (bhakti). With right
            understanding, one need not renounce actions but merely the desire
            (kama) for the fruits of actions, acting without desire (nishkama
            karma).
          </p>
        </article>
        <p class="st">
          The moral impasse is not so much resolved as destroyed when Krishna
          assumes his doomsday form—a fiery, gaping mouth, swallowing up all
          creatures in the universe at the end of the eon—after Arjuna asks
          Krishna to reveal his true cosmic nature. In the middle of this
          terrifying epiphany, Arjuna apologizes to Krishna for the many times
          when he had rashly and casually called out to him as a friend. He begs
          Krishna to return to his previous form, which the god consents to do,
          resuming his role as intimate human companion of the warrior Arjuna.
          The Gita has always been cherished by many Hindus for its spiritual
          guidance, but it achieved new prominence in the 19th century, when the
          British in India lauded it as the Hindu equivalent of the New
          Testament and when American philosophers—particularly the New England
          Transcendentalists Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David
          Thoreau—considered it to be the pivotal Hindu text.

              The Bhagavadgita is an episode recorded in the Mahabharata, a
              Sanskrit epic poem of ancient India. It is an influential
              religious text in Hinduism that takes the form of a dialogue
              between Prince Arjuna and Krishna, an avatar of the Hindu deity
              Vishnu. It was likely composed in the 1st or 2nd century CE. It is
              commonly referred to as the Gita.

            <p>
              The name Bhagavadgita comes from the Sanskrit for “Song of God.”

            <p>
              In the Bhagavadgita, Krishna teaches that one can kill only the
              body; the soul is immortal. At death, the soul is reborn in
              another body, or, for those who have fully grasped the true
              teachings, it achieves release (moksha) or extinction
              (nirvana)—that is, freedom from the wheel of rebirth.

          <div class="qn">

              On the brink of a great battle, Arjuna is overwhelmed with
              misgivings and expresses his qualms to Krishna, his charioteer—a
              combination bodyguard and court historian. Krishna persuades
              Arjuna to do his duty as a man born into the class of warriors,
              which is to fight. Arjuna’s dilemma thus draws a response from
              Krishna that expands to become an expression of the central themes
              of the Bhagavadgita.
